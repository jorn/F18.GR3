The manipulation of sound and audio signals is a big area in electronics and the analog systems of the past are now moving to the digital world. In this project, the basic implementation of digital signal processing (DSP) is explored and combined with the fundamental principles of implementing a module based audio effect system in an embedded system running on a single Cortex-M4 based microcontroller from Texas Instrument. As a supporting framework, the real time operating system FreeRTOS is used. To make the signal conversion from analog to digital and back possible, analog antialiasing and reconstruction filters are used. The chosen filter design and system at howle, is analysed and tested to provide a basis for an evaluation. To provide some functionality, an echo and a reverb effect are designed for the system.
